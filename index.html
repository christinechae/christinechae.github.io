  JUST DO IT!
  </h1>
<p id="random">
Don't let your dreams be dreams
Yesterday you said tomorrow
So just do it
Make your dreams come true
Just do it
Some people dream of success
While you're gonna wake up and work hard at it
Nothing is impossible
You should get to the point
Where anyone else would quit
And you're not going to stop there
No, what are you waiting for?
Do it
Just do it
Yes you can
Just do it
If you're tired of starting over
Stop giving up
